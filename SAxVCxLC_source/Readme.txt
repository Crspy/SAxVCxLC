In the following directories ending with _root are necessarily copied to the GTA root folder. Directories without the suffix _root can be copied either to the root folder or to the modloader folder depending on the choice during installation.

base(_root) - Essential files translated from VC and LC to SA. This is a raw version without any additions or modifications of the map. This version must be so pure that main.scm from VC and LC can be converted to SA and will work.

extras(_root) - Minor additions/modifications that everybody definitely wants. Standard SAxVCxLC = base + extras + music. All existing mods for SA must also work with SAxVCxLC.

music - Because this folder is very big and because it could be used with base but without extras, it is separated here.

MTA - Files for Multi Theft Auto (online multiplayer)

otherMods(_root) - Mods for SAxVCxLC should be provided by modders on various websites. However, some mods are so extremely common (fixing issues or providing some important functionality), that they can be provided as optional mods here if the authors of the mods agree. Include only mods that are very important.
